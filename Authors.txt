sfeMovie has been written by Lucas Soltic (ie. Ceylo) with help from:

- Laurent Gomila as author of SFML
- Loïc Siquet as Windows developer
- Alexandre Janniaux as Linux developer
- Martin Bohme as author of the FFmpeg tutorial at http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/
- Xorlium and timidouveg who worked on their own video integration packages from which was partly inspired sfeMovie (their project page does no more exist)
