Coding conventions
==================

sfeMovie coding conventions globally follow SFML's ones, which are:
- { and } on their own line
- all blocks contents are indented (including switch blocks)
- indent with spaces by 4 spaces, no tabs
- class names are CamelCase
- method names are camelCase
- structure and class members are m_camelCase
- constants are CamelCase

A few additions / differences are:
- /** Doc
   * 
   * @param aParam explanation
   */
   Doxygen comment style
